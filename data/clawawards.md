title: Welcome to The Claw Community Awards
description:
  Each year, we celebrate the fun memories, jokes and clips from across the year in a variety of categories. The community gets to decide on the categories and then gets to vote. It's a great way to be involved and who knows, maybe you will win an award for something! Use the form below to store memories of things you might want to remember for the next awards! Build stuff, learn things, love what you do.
