## Welcome to The Claw Stream Team!

We are so excited that you've joined us! Here's a list of resources to get you onboarded onto the
team.

## Code of Conduct

[The Claw Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) is designed to keep you and your community safe. Please
take a moment to read through it and familiarise yourself with it. Feel free to reference all or
part of it to use to support your streams and extended community.

## Your page on theclaw.team

Upon joining the team, a page at theclaw.team/{yourTwitchLogin} will be generated for you. The data
is fetched from an API that is refreshed every hour using up-to-date data from Twitch. You'll see
your Twitch avatar, bio, emotes, link to your page on Twitch, schedule and latest stream
information. If you share this page on social media, you'll also see a dynamically generated Open
Graph image. Give it a try!

## Branded overlays for your stream

In the [backstage area](/backstage), you'll find links to branded overlays you can use freely on
your streams if you wish. These are not mandatory! The overlays are behind Twitch auth to ensure
only team members have access to them. To add an overlay to OBS:

1. Add a new browser source with the overlay URL you wish to use
1. Right click the browser source and choose "interact"
1. Log in to the overlay via Twitch

If you have any ideas for new branded overlays, please
[submit an issue via GitHub](https://github.com/whitep4nth3r/theclaw.team/issues), or submit your
own via PR!

## Team channel in Discord

As a team member, you'll be given the Discord role Twitch Team Member which will give you access to
some private channels.

## Build stuff, learn things, love what you do

Thank you for being a part of The Claw Stream Team!
